# Car-Price-Prediction
The Car Price Prediction model leverages machine learning techniques to predict the market value of a car. This project aims to understand how different factors, such as the car's age, mileage, brand, and other features, influence its price. Regression models such as Linear and Lasso are explored in this project.
